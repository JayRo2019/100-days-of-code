### Day 68: March 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Worked through freeCodeCamp curriculum and Turing School prework.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad someone on Twitter shared the official rules of the 100 Days of Code challenge. This is more engaging than tweets, since I get to practice using markdown and GitHub.
