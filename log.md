# 100 Days Of Code (R1) - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2019 - Day 67: March 18, 2019 (Twitter Updates)

### Day 68: March 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Worked through freeCodeCampCurriculum and Turing School prework.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad someone on Twitter shared the official rules of the 100 Days of Code challenge. This is more engaging than tweets, since I get to practice using markdown and GitHub.
